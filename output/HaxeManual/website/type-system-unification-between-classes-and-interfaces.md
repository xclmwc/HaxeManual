## 3.5.1 Between Class/Interface

When defining unification behavior between classes, it is important to remember that unification is directional: We can assign a more specialized class (e.g. a child class) to a generic class (e.g. a parent class) but the reverse is not valid.

The following assignments are allowed:

* child class to parent class
* class to implementing interface
* interface to base interface

These rules are transitive, meaning that a child class can also be assigned to the base class of its base class, an interface its base class implements, the base interface of an implementing interface and so on.
