## 2.1 Basic Types

**Basic types** are `Bool`, `Float` and `Int`. They can easily be identified in the syntax by values such as

* `true` and `false` for `Bool`,
* `1`, `0`, `-1` and `0xFF0000` for `Int` and
* `1.0`, `0.0`, `-1.0`, `1e10` for `Float`.

Basic types are not [classes](types-class-instance.md) in Haxe. They are implemented as [abstract types](types-abstract.md) and are tied to the compiler's internal operator-handling as described in the following sections.
